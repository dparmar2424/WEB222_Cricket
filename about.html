                <h2>Here is brief introduction about myself(author):</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Diya Parmar, but you might know me better as 'ElectricEagle' when I used to play cricket. 
                    When it comes to Minecraft, I stick with the name 'ElectricEagle' since this game requires a lot pf energy.
                  What sets cricket apart from some other  games is that you can interect with a lot of people white playing this.
                  Hence it allows you to get in touch with a lot of people and this ultimately gives a team-working envionment. 
                    I'm a big fan of Cricket and wanted to express my passion for the game by creating this website.
                </p>
       
                <h2>Here are some main reasons behind creating this website:</h2> 
   <ul type="disc">
