                <h2><b>A brief History of Cricket:</b></h2>
                <p>
                    Cricket is a popular team sport that originated in England in the 16th century. 
                    The game has since spread to many other parts of the world, particularly in countries that were part of the British Empire.
                    The earliest known reference to cricket dates back to the late 16th century, and the game 
                    was popularized in the 18th century with the formation of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. 
                    The MCC became the official governing body of the sport and established the rules that are still used today.
                </p>
            <p>
                The popularity of cricket continued to grow throughout the 20th century, with many countries establishing their
                 own cricket boards and participating in international competitions. The World Cup, a major international cricket 
                 tournament, was first held in 1975 and has since become one of the most prestigious events in the sport.
                Today, cricket is played at both amateur and professional levels, with international matches and tournaments
                 being watched by millions of fans around the world. It remains a popular sport in countries such as 
                 India, Pakistan, Australia, England, and the West Indies.

                <h2>Different roles in cricket:</h2>
                <p>
                    Cricket is a team sport that involves several different roles, each with its own specific responsibilities.
                     Here are some of the key roles in cricket:
                    <ol type = "A">
                  <li>Batsman:</li><p>The batsman is responsible for scoring runs by hitting the ball with the bat. 
                    There are two batsmen on the field at a time, and they take turns facing the bowler.</p>

                  <li>Bowler:</li><p>The bowler is responsible for delivering the ball to the batsman. 
                    The bowler's primary objective is to take wickets (dismissals) by getting the batsman out.</p>

                <li>Wicket-keeper:</li><p>The wicket-keeper is a player who stands behind the stumps and catches the ball if the batsman misses it. 
                    The wicket-keeper also helps to stump the batsman if they leave their crease while the ball is in play. </p>
                <li>Fielder:</li><p>The fielder is responsible for stopping the ball and preventing the batsman from scoring runs. 
                    There are several fielding positions on the field, each with its own specific role and responsibilities.</p>

               <li>Captain:</li><p>The captain is responsible for making strategic decisions on the field, such as which bowlers to use and where to position the fielders.
                 The captain also communicates with the umpires and represents the team in meetings and interviews.</p>
               <li>Umpire: </li><p>The umpire is responsible for making decisions on the field, such as whether a batsman is out or not. 
                There are two on-field umpires in cricket, and they work together to ensure that the game is played fairly and according to the rules.


                These are just a few of the key roles in cricket. 
                Each player on the field plays an important part in the game, and teamwork and communication are essential for success.</p></ol>

              <h2> Cricket is a sport that involves two teams of 11 players each, with each team taking turns to bat and bowl. 
                Here are the basic steps to play cricket:</h2>
              
              <ul type = "square">
               <li><b>Toss:</b></li>

                <p>Before the start of the match, the two captains meet at the center of the pitch for a coin toss.
                 The winning captain chooses whether to bat or bowl first
                
               <li><b>Innings:</b></li>

                <p>The team that wins the toss chooses to bat or bowl first. 
                    The team batting first is called the "innings" and their aim is to score as many runs as possible.</p>
                <li><b>Bowling:</b></li>

                <p>The team bowling first aims to take wickets (dismissals) and prevent the batting team from scoring runs. 
                    The bowler delivers the ball to the batsman, who tries to hit the ball and score runs.</p>
                <li><b>Fielding:</b></li>

                <p>The fielding team aims to stop the ball and prevent the batting team from scoring runs. 
                    Fielders are positioned around the field in different positions.</p>
                
                <li><b>Change of innings:</b></li>

                <p>After the first team completes their innings, the teams switch roles. 
                    The team that was bowling now gets to bat, and the team that was batting now gets to bowl.

                </p>
                <li><b>Scoring:</b></li>

                <p>Each time the batsman hits the ball and runs to the other end of the pitch, they score one run. If the ball crosses the boundary of the field, the batting team scores four runs (a "boundary"). 
                    If the ball is hit over the boundary without touching the ground, the batting team scores six runs (a "six").</p>
                </p>
                <li><b>Wickets:</b></li>

                <p>The bowling team aims to take wickets by getting the batsman out. 
                    The most common ways to get a wicket are by bowling the ball and hitting the wickets (a "bowled" dismissal), 
                    catching the ball after it is hit by the batsman (a "caught" dismissal), or hitting the wickets with the ball
                     after the batsman leaves their crease (a "run-out" dismissal)., and the team that was batting now gets to bowl.
                 </p>
                <li><b>End of match:</b></li>

                <p>The match is over when both teams have completed their innings. The team that scores the most runs is declared the winner.
                These are just the basic steps of cricket, and there are many other rules and nuances to the game. 
                However, following these steps is a good starting point for anyone who wants to learn how to play cricket.</p>
